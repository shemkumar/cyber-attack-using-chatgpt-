                    <h2>Attack</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this research, we investigate how generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), can be used to generate novel cyber attack strategies. By leveraging AI, malicious actors could potentially develop sophisticated attack methods that evade traditional security mechanisms.

                    <h2>DEFENSE</h2>
                    <p>
                        The DEFENSE section explores the countermeasures against AI-driven cyber threats. We focus on how generative models could be applied to defend against attacks by predicting attack strategies and proactively adjusting defensive protocols.

                    <p>
                        In the Threat Analysis section, we analyze the evolving landscape of cyber threats. This research involves studying the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cybercriminals, as well as identifying emerging threat vectors.

        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project, MalGenAI, explores the use of generative models in the context of cybersecurity, aiming to enhance our understanding of both offensive and defensive strategies in cyber warfare. We study how AI can be employed to create both sophisticated attacks and intelligent defenses. This research is crucial for developing next-generation security measures and anticipating future cyber threats.
