        <h1>Defense Strategies</h1>
        <p>Explore how AI and generative models can be used to defend against cyber threats and mitigate risks.</p>
        
        <section>
            <h2>1. Automated Defense Mechanisms</h2>
            <p>Generative models can be used to automatically generate defense strategies, such as security patches, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, based on attack patterns.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>2. Intrusion Detection Systems</h2>
            <p>AI models can learn from vast datasets of cyber attacks to identify patterns and anomalies in network traffic, helping to detect and block unauthorized access attempts in real-time.</p>

            <h2>3. Threat Intelligence Sharing</h2>
            <p>By using generative models, organizations can create and share threat intelligence in an automated manner, making it easier to detect and respond to emerging threats.</p>
